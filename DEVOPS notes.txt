What is SDLC?
software developement lifecycle

Lifecycle models
1.Water flow(irriversible model)
2.Agile mode(Split project into multiple parts known as Sprint)
3.continuous integration continuous deployement

Why we need devops?
faster delivery
higher quality
less capex opex
reduced outage

---SDLC Waterfall model----
developers(github for version mngmnt)
  |
  |
Build (maven deploy to test server)
  |
  |
test(selenium)
  |
  |
QA


Deploy(chef/ansible/docker/puppet deploy to production servr)
|
|
manintainance

monitoring(nagios/cloudwatch)

part 1st handled by dev team and 2nd will be managed by operation team,so every morning meeting for syncing of both team called as scrum/sync meeting.

there are diffrnt products by csps
azure-azure devops,azure repos, azure artifect
aws-aws codecommit,cloudwatch,code deploy,codepipeline

but in practical maven,ansible,puppet,chef,nagios, mostly used because of open source and cross platform capable.
(devops-implementing automation to each and every stages)

git-(version control)--maintains version of code
continuous integration--complie validate,review,unit testing,integration testing (eg-jenkins)
continuous delivery--deploying to test server(eg.maven)
contious deployement--deploying test app on production server



Agile(Build Short Build Often)
consider 1,2 3..blocks known as sprint

sprint1-login logout page 
sprint2-images and data contents
sprint3-payment gateway
...and so on...
Also called as scrum framework.


Now coming to Linux part
What is Linux?
linux is opensource operatiing system that directly manages system hardware resources.
developed by linus torward in 1991 created from scratch...invented free linux kernel by taking refernece of unix and minix.

because unix was not opensource that time.following are most used flavors
IBM(AIX)
SUN(SOLARIS)
MACOS
HP(UX)
 
Linux flavours
redhat
fedora
debian
ubuntu(3rd largest used in world)
other(centos,amazon os) 

diffrence between windows and linux
windows flow
user
shell
os
hardware

linux flow
user 
shell
kernal
hardware

terms used in linux
folder-directory
administrator-root user
software-package
file-file

now file system herarchy
/
/root--contains users data
/home--other users data
/bin--comands used by root user and other user
/sbin--commands used by root user only
/dev--contains all devices information
/opt--optional folder for software installation
/etc--contains all configuration files
/boot--contains all boot information
/usr--default software installation folder

file commands
1.cat
u can create and write new file.cant edit with this command.
also concatinate two or more files into single file

2.touch
touch command used to create empty file.or multiple files at once.
also used this command for managing stat of the files
ex.access date
   modify date
   change date

3.vi/vim
 vi editor is mostly used editor.because it is by defaukt available in all version of linux.
you can create or modify file using vim

4.nano
 nano editor is not installed by default on all version of linux.apart from vim editor in nano command or shortcut information given in editor's last line.

-rw-r--r--    1 root     root           151 Jul  5  2020 readme.txt

cat > file1
create file 1.

cat file1 file2 > file12
also concatinate both files

touch file1
creates empty file1.

touch file1 file2 file3
creates multiple empty files.

vi 
:w --write n save file
:wq--write and quit
:q-- quit without saving
:q!--exit forcefully

nano
ctrl+x for closing file


Directory commands

ls -l   --list all folder contains
ls -a  --show all contains including hidden files/folders

1.mkdir folder1
  create directory
2.mkdir -p /folder1/folder2/folder3
  creates all folders and inside folders
  as / showing in starting it means folder path is in root folder.
3.cd
 current directory
4.cd..
 get one step back from current folder
5.pwd
 print current working directory
6.mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3
 creates all 3 folders
7.rm dir1 dir2
 remove folders named dir1 dir2
8.rm -rf
 remove forcefully
 eg. rm -rf dir1


file operation commands

(copy)
 cp file1 file2
 copying content of file1 to file2

(moving)
 mv file1 file2
 moving content of file1 to file2
 
 mv file1 folder2
 moving file1 to folder2

hostname(show hostname)
hostname -i (only show ip address)
yum(yellowdog updater modifier)
yum manager is most popular and installed in almost all linux.

yum install httpd (installs httpd service)
yum remove httpd  (removes httpd service)
service httpd status (show httpd status)
service httpd start  (start service)
chkconfig httpd on  (register service as startup service) 
chkconfig httpd off  (removes from startup services)
which chef  (you can check chef installed or not with which command)
whoomi  (name of current user)
echo "hello" (shows hello output on all terminals at same time)
echo "hello" > file1 (save this hello output in file1)
grep(grep used to find word or phrase in text)
eg. grep root /etc/password (find root word from file password)
sort (sort file contains alphabetically)
yum install tree(install tree package if not installed)
tree (shows folders files as binary tree)
e.g dir11
     |

        |
        |dir32

User/group add commands
useradd mayur(creates user named mayur)
cat /etc/passwd (last line shows recently added user)
in this case automatically group gets added named as mayur.
